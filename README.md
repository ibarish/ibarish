üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

Hi there! üëã

I'm a passionate software developer with a focus on full-stack development, mobile applications, and backend systems.
I currently work at a machine manufacturing company where I lead projects that:

Support digital transformation

Integrate with ERP systems

Improve production monitoring and operational efficiency

In addition to my professional work, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, building useful tools, and sharing knowledge with the developer community.

If you enjoy what I do and want to support my journey, feel free to buy me a coffee ‚òï ‚Äî your support keeps me motivated and helps me continue creating great software!
